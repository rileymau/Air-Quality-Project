## Project Description

Air Quality Zipcode Lookup is a web app that shows current Air Quality Index (AQI).  The user enters a zip code and sees air quality data for that day and every day for the previous week.   The web page displays a chart showing the air quality index for PM2.5 and ozone AQI.  The website includes Flask routes for creating a search from the user's zipcode lookup and saving it to the database,  and finding all searches for a user. The additional features include a chart showing data from all searches for a given zipcode.  The user can also input days and the app looks up the AQI info for that day and adds it to the chart.  This website is helpful for people planning trips, or for researching air quality where they live or are planning to move.
