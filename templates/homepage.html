  <h2>About this website</h2>
  <!--side by side layout later-->

  <p>
    Login as a user, and then do an Air quality search. Air Quality Index (AQI) has many measurements.
    <br>Two important ones are ground level ozone (ozone), and particle matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM 2.5).
    </p>
    <p>
    A variety of air quality data is available.  This website searches for ozone and PM 2.5 data by 
    <br>zipcode or by reporting area.  Cities and towns are assigned to larger reporting areas that share measurements. 
    <br>The extended search pages has a summary of the last year's AQI's for any zipcode or reporting area. 
    </p>
